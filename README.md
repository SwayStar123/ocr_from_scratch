# OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

This is a project attempting to put AI on the blockchain, *Including the training process*!

Written in the [Sway](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway) language, running on the [Fuel](https://fuel.network) blockchain.

Trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset for just one epoch, with a learning rate of 0.015 and a Neural Network shape of 784 x 10 x 15 x 10.

You can try it out with your own handwritten digits fully onchain over here -> [todo](link)

(There is no real purpose of this, just a fun project)
